# File Sharing Guidelines

## General Information (read this first)
Basically, most of the unallowed services for sharing files are slow or require payment. So if you are going to share a file using this type of  service, it will be removed. For allowed services, make sure that they are somewhat fast and does not require any payment whatsoever.

Honestly, the best option would be Google Drive because it is unlimited and is the most fast and accessible file sharing service out there.
